# Tata Steel Sailing Club Website

## Introduction

This is a Laminas MVC website build for the Tata Steel Sailing Club.

## Installation using Composer

The project can be build using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). If you don't have it already installed,
then please install as per the [documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

To create your new project:

```bash
$ composer create-project -sdev tata-website/tata-steel-sailing path/to/install
```

Once installed, you can test it out immediately using PHP's built-in web server:

```bash
$ cd path/to/install
$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public
# OR use the composer alias:
$ composer run --timeout 0 serve
```

This will start the cli-server on port 8080, and bind it to all network
interfaces. You can then visit the site at http://localhost:8080/.

**Note:** The built-in CLI server is *for development only*.

## Apache setup

To setup apache, setup a virtual host to point to the public/ directory of the
project and you should be ready to go! It should look something like below:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName laminasapp.localhost
    DocumentRoot /path/to/laminasapp/public
    <Directory /path/to/laminasapp/public>
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
        Require all granted
        </IfModule>
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```
