            <p>When you join the club, you agree to comply with all the Club Rules, and agreed policies, and procedures. Members introducing or receiving visiting sailors or windsurfers must ask them to complete a day sailing form or open entry form; these forms also include a declaration agreeing to comply with club rules, policies, and procedures, plus a statement on limitations of the club’s liability.</p>
            <p>
                This page contains the club rules, policies, and procedures.
                The authority for the main rules is the club’s Constitution (see section 22 of this document);
                this can only be changed by a Special General Meeting.</p>
            <p>Other club rules, policies, and procedures, including Standing Orders (section 3),
                have been developed over the years to ensure members can participate in club activities in a enjoyable, and safe manner.
                The club’s Management Committee is empowered to write and amend such rules, policies, and procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
                The club has agreed that its rules, including those concerning safety, sailing matters, and training,
                will be consistent with the guidelines of the Royal Yachting Association (RYA).
            </p>

            <h1 class="page-header pb-3 mb-3">2. Bio-security</h1>
            <h4>2.1 Bio-security warning</h4>
            <p>We have a non European shrimp at Eglwys Nunnydd Reservoir - Dikerogammarus villosus.</p>
            <p>Although completely harmless to humans, it does have a seriously adverse effect on UK freshwater life, eggs etc., in fresh and brackish water.</p>
            <p>The following measures have been introduced to minimise the likelihood of sailors and windsurfers spreading this creature to other water catchment areas.</p>
            <p>Before any dinghy sailor or windsurfer takes their craft away from Tata Steel Sailing Club:</p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">You must not leave any trolley or trailer in the water when launching.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">You are required to inspect your craft for shrimp and weed etc., and thoroughly wash with the hoses provided. Pay particular attention to washing sails, masts, and other nooks and crannies such as Topper and Laser mast holes, slots on sailboards etc.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Trolleys, which have been immersed in the water, need special attention to ensure hollow tubes are flushed through – pay attention to wheels and support cradles.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Your craft and trolley needs to be completely drained after washing.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">You must inspect your sailing gear, including wetsuit boots, buoyancy aids, etc., and remove any shrimp</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Visiting powerboats and trailers need to be similarly cleaned before leaving the site, with special attention to bilges and engine cooling systems, which also need to be flushed through.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="page-header pb-3 mb-3"><a href="<?= $this->basePath('/docs/3 Standing Orders.pdf') ?>" target="_blank">3. Standing Orders</a></h1>

            <h1 class="page-header pb-3 mb-3">4. Essential advice for new and existing members</h1>
            <h4>4.1 Borrowing Club Boats</h4>
            <p>Club boats are not generally available, however, when a club basic training course has been completed, and the RYA level 2 certificate, or the youth sailing scheme (YSS) level 2 certificate has been obtained, trainees are entitled to borrow a club dinghy in the year of training, up to the 31st December, during organised sailing sessions, provided they are not being used by the dinghy instructors; If for any reason there is a need for any boats to be borrowed against the advice above approval of at least three members of the management committee will be required.</p>
            <h4>4.2 On the water essentials</h4>
            <p>Before taking to the water you must complete the sign on sheet. See section 6.2. See sections 3.8 and 9 if you are intending to sail or windsurf, but not to take part in the racing programme on the day. Trolleys must not be left in the water upon launching, as there is a danger to craft, helms and crews returning to the slipway, and contamination by killer shrimp. Additionally trolleys should not block access to the clubhouse by emergency vehicles.</p>
            <h4>4.3 Extra Windsurfing Rule</h4>
            <p>All the club rules that apply to dinghy sailing also applies to windsurfing, there is only one safety rule that is different: Windsurfers requiring assistance should if possible sit on their board and wave both hands in the air to attract attention.</p>

            <h1 class="page-header pb-3 mb-3">5. Gaining access to the club, and locking up</h1>
            <h4>5.1 The outer reservoir gate</h4>
            <p>Under instructions from TATA the outer reservoir gate is to be kept closed and locked at all times. Persons authorised to enter the reservoir have a key or know our combination lock code.</p>
            <h4>5.2 Do not drive home with the locks in your pocket; it's happened.</h4><br>
            <h4>5.3 Don’t hand over the lock to anyone you do not know, or assume they will lock the gate.</h4><br>
            <h4>5.4 When you are at the club, and if you answer the phone in the lounge, pass the call to one of the club’s committee members; do not divulge the gate code.</h4><br>
            <h4>5.3 The dinghy compound gate</h4><br>
            <p>Members can obtain a key for the gate by paying a refundable deposit. If you are not a key holder, make sure you are not the last to leave; if you hold a key and are the last to leave the club, you must lock the gate behind you, otherwise you will be putting member and club assets at risk.</p>

            <h1 class="page-header pb-3 mb-3">6. Member (including parent) duties and responsibilities &amp; (DBS information)</a></h1>
            <h4>6.1 Sailing Management Duties (n/a to guests, visitors, day sailors)</h4>
            <p>It is a condition of membership that all members, over the age of 16, undertake sailing management duties when requested by the Club, and that non-compliance may lead to membership suspension. Three suitable dates are asked for when renewing your membership. Rostered members are responsible for finding a replacement in the event of being unable to undertake their duty, it is not sufficient to inform the Management Committee; please check the club website for the dates of your duties.</p>
            <p>On three or four days per annum, a new member will normally be rostered as an assistant to the race management team; as an assistant, you will learn about running the racing and casual sailing programmes, including the use of the club’s Powerboats. New members are encouraged to watch a team at work before the day they have been rostered on. For more information see Sections 8 to 15 in this folder.</p>
            <h4>6.2 Completing the Sign On sheet (applies to all sailors and windsurfers)</h4>
            <p>You must complete the “Sign On” sheet for the day (Sailing Register) each time you sail or windsurf. The sign on sheet is located on the table in the clubhouse hallway. Parents and Guardians must countersign this sheet if their youngsters are sailing without their parent guardian.</p>
            <p>Adjacent to the sign on sheet is “the conditions for sailing notice”. see section 6.4. Your signature on the sign on sheet is your agreement to the conditions specified in the notice.</p>
            <p>For racing, no race result will be awarded unless the sign on procedure is completed.</p>
            <h4>6.3 Other responsibilities and advice</h4>
            <p>Please read the entire contents of this folder to gain a good understanding of the club; please pay particular attention to Sections 18, 19 and 20 which deal with health and safety; Section 18 sets out the Major Incident Procedure and Section 20.7 details the club’s policy on young persons welfare.</p>
            <h4>6.4 Conditions for Sailing, Windsurfing or Racing</h4>
            <p>All those sailing, including windsurfers, must complete the Sign On Register.</p>
            <p>The register is a record of all those intending to sail.</p>
            <p>A secure buoyancy aid must worn when on and near the water, and clothing adequate for the conditions is necessary.</p>
            <p>You must not launch before a powerboat is manned and on the water and the club flag is flying.</p>
            <p>No safety cover may be available outside race times e.g. during the lunch break between races.</p>
            <h4>6.5 Your Responsibilities for Health and Safety</h4>
            <p>Participants taking to the water are responsible for their own safety, whether afloat or ashore, and nothing reduces this responsibility. (see also parents / guardians below).</p>
            <p>It is for helms / parents guardians/windsurfers to decide whether their craft is fit to sail in the conditions in which it will find itself. By launching helms or parents / guardians/windsurfers confirm their craft is fit for the prevailing and forecast conditions, and that they or their dependants are fit and competent to sail or compete in them. Race officials, including patrol boat crews, have a responsibility to keep watch for sailors and windsurfer's in apparent difficulty, and attend capsizes or other events as soon as possible, if the safety of the participants may be in doubt. However, nothing done by the organisers can reduce the responsibility of the owners and / or sailors / parents / guardians, nor will it make the organisers responsible, for any loss, damage, death or personal injury, however it may have occurred, as a result of sailors taking part in the activity. The provision of Powerboats does not relieve owners and or sailors of their responsibilities for their own safety and the safety of their craft.</p>
            <h4>6.6 Parents / Guardians of dependant Sailors and Windsurfers</h4>
            <p>A counter-signature is required on the sign on register confirming parental permission for their dependant(s) to race, or sail casually.</p>
            <p>Parents are responsible for their dependant’s behaviour whilst racing, or casual sailing, and for their safety and behaviour whilst ashore. The Parent signature is an acceptance of the parent’s responsibilities, including any decision on the fitness and competence of their youngsters, and the fitness of the craft for the prevailing or anticipated weather conditions.</p>
            <p>The provision of patrol craft for activities on the water does not absolve parents of these responsibilities. If in doubt the advice of the organisers should be sought, but the decision to sail remains with the parent / guardian. The parent / guardian, or adult acting in loco parentis, who has signed the Signing On sheet or similar record must be in attendance the whole time their dependant(s) are at the club, or inform club officials of another adult who will undertake this responsibility.</p>

            <h1 class="page-header pb-3 mb-3">7. Limitation of the club’s liability</h1>
            <h4>7.1 Limitation of the Club’s Liability</h4>
            <p>
                Members of the Club and their guests or visitors, may use the Club
                premises and other facilities of the Club, entirely at their own risk
                and by implication accept the conditions below. Before inviting any
                guest(s) or visitor(s) onto the Club’s premises, or when greeting
                day sailors, members should draw their attention to these
                conditions.
            </p>
            <h4>7.2 General Conditions</h4>
            <p>
                The Club will not accept any liability for any damage to, or loss of
                property belonging to members, guests or visitors.
                The Club will not accept any liability for personal injury arising out
                of the use of the premises and any other facilities of the Club, or
                out of participation in any sailing/windsurfing event organised by
                the Club, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
            </p>
            <h4>7.3 Sailing activities (applicable to racing and casual sailing)</h4>
            <p>
                Sailors/windsurfers are entirely responsible for their own safety,
                whether afloat or on shore, and nothing reduces this
                responsibility. It is for sailors to decide if their boat is fit to sail in
                the conditions in which it will find itself. By launching sailors
                confirm that the boat is fit for those conditions and that they are
                fit and competent to compete and sail/windsurf in/on them.
                Nothing done by the organisers can reduce the responsibility of
                the craft owners and ,or sailors/windsurfers, nor will it make the
                organisers responsible for any loss, damage, death or personal
                injury, however it may have occurred, as a result of the craft
                taking part in the sailing/windsurfing. The organisers encompass
                everyone helping to run the activity.
                Patrol boats will be arranged by the club during organised
                activities according to the circumstances, and every effort will be
                made to provide advice and assistance in cases of difficulty.
                However the provision of Patrol-boats does not relieve owners and
                sailors/windsurfers of their responsibilities to themselves, their
                craft, and others.
                Before taking part in any sailing/windsurfing activity, members
                and guests are requested to sign the “Sign On” register confirming
                their acceptance of these conditions. See section 6.
            </p>
            <h4>7.4 Persons under 18 years of age</h4>
            <p>See section 6.6.</p>
            <h4>7.5 Sailing instruction / coaching – applies to club training & tasters</h4>
            <p>
                The RYA Senior Instructors, Coaches, Instructors, and assistants do not accept responsibility for any loss, damage or injury suffered
                by persons and, or their property, arising out of, or during the course of their activities whilst training, and, or coaching and,
                or instructing, unless such injury, loss. or damage was caused by, or resulted from negligence or deliberate act.
            <p>
            <h4>7.6 Additional Activities</h4>
            <p>
                Where there is more than one activity taking place on the water,
                e.g. Club racing/windsurfing and training or any other activity over
                and above racing/windsurfing, an onshore Safety Officer must be
                appointed to oversee the use of patrol boats to cover all the
                activities on the water.
            </p>
